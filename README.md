# Genetic Prompt

This project implements the Genetic Prompt generation process and provides programs for testing classification performance.

## Usage

### Reproducing Genetic Prompt Generation
Modify file parameters in `gen_train_data` to reproduce the Genetic Prompt generation process.

### Testing Classification Performance
Use the provided Data files with programs in the RE folder to test classification performance.

## Project Structure

- `gen_train_data/`: Scripts and config files for generating Genetic Prompts
- `Data/`: Preprocessed data files
- `RE/`: Programs for testing classification performance
