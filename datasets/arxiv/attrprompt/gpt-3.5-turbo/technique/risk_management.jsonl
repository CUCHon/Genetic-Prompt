1. Monte Carlo simulation: a computational technique used to model risk and uncertainty by simulating a wide range of possible outcomes and determining the probabilities of different outcomes.

2. Decision tree analysis: a method for evaluating risk by creating a decision tree that maps out potential decisions and their associated risks, costs, and benefits.

3. Qualitative risk analysis: a method of assessing risk that relies on expert judgment and qualitative criteria rather than statistical data or modeling.

4. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA): a structured approach to identifying and analyzing potential failures in a system, process, or product and assessing their impact and likelihood.

5. Event tree analysis: a technique for assessing risk by visually mapping out potential events and their consequences, allowing analysts to identify critical control points and potential hazards.

6. Bayesian networks: a probabilistic graphical model that represents the relationships between different variables and events, allowing analysts to model complex systems and assess risk.

7. Fault-tree analysis: a method for analyzing risk by tracing the different paths that can lead to a system failure and assessing the likelihood of each.

8. Root cause analysis: a method for identifying the underlying causes of a problem or failure and determining the best way to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future.

9. Sensitivity analysis: a method for evaluating risk by examining how changes to different variables or assumptions might affect the overall outcome.

10. Scenario and stress testing: a technique for assessing risk by generating and evaluating a range of possible scenarios and extreme conditions to determine how a system or organization might respond.
