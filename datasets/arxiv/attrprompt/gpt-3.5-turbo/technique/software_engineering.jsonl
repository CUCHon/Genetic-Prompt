Agile Development: Agile development is an iterative and collaborative software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, adaptability, and customer collaboration, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software incrementally and respond to changing requirements.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects, enabling modular design, code reuse, and encapsulation of data and behavior.
Test-Driven Development (TDD): Test-driven development is a software development technique that involves writing tests before writing the corresponding code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements and remains maintainable and testable.
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)
Design Patterns: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems, providing a structured approach to designing software systems and promoting code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.
Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture: MVC is a software architectural pattern that separates the concerns of data, presentation, and user interaction, promoting modularity, code organization, and ease of maintenance in software systems.
Refactoring: Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, improving its internal structure, readability, and maintainability, often by applying automated code refactorings or design principles.
Software Testing Techniques: Software testing techniques encompass a range of approaches such as black-box testing, white-box testing, unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing, ensuring the correctness, robustness, and reliability of software systems.
Version Control Systems: Version control systems like Git enable collaborative development, allowing developers to track and manage changes to source code, coordinate team contributions, and revert to previous versions when needed.
Software Metrics and Quality Assurance: Software metrics and quality assurance techniques involve assessing and improving software quality, utilizing approaches like code reviews, code analysis tools, code coverage analysis, and performance profiling to ensure high-quality and efficient software.
