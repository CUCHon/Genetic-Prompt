1. Potential theory: A mathematical framework for studying harmonic functions that can be used to solve problems in electrostatics, fluid mechanics, and other fields.
2. Complex dynamics: The study of the iteration of complex-valued functions or mappings. This can be used to study the behavior of systems that exhibit chaos or fractal patterns.
3. Complex analysis on Riemann surfaces: The study of complex analysis on a specific type of manifold known as a Riemann surface.
4. Conformal mapping: The study of functions that preserve angles between curves. This can be used to solve problems in fluid mechanics, conformal field theory, and other fields.
5. Potential theoretic methods in partial differential equations: The use of potential theory to solve partial differential equations in a variety of contexts such as electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and elasticity.
6. Holomorphic dynamics: The study of the iteration of holomorphic functions or mappings. This can be used to study the behavior of dynamical systems in the complex plane.
7. Complex function theory: A general framework for studying functions that take complex values. This can be used to study a wide range of mathematical and physical phenomena, from differential equations to quantum mechanics.
8. Geometric function theory: The study of the geometric properties of complex-valued functions and their relations to other mathematical objects such as curves and surfaces.
9. Operator theory: A branch of functional analysis concerned with the study of linear operators on function spaces. This can be used to study the behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems in mathematics and science.
10. Potential theoretic methods in complex geometry: The use of potential theory to study geometric objects in complex analysis such as complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties.
